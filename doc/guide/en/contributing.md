### Contributing

We welcome contributions from forward-thinking hackers keen to redefine what's possible on the web. Big, bold ideas, unconstrained by frameworks and concepts from the past will always be welcome.

The best developers take 10 lines of code and come up with a completely new design that needs 3. If you're one of these rare breed of people we'd love to have you onboard as a potential member of our core team. Test writers and creators of beautiful documentation will receive our maximum appreciation and support as they seek to keep up with a rapidly moving target.

Before you add a major new feature to SocketStream and submit a pull request, bear in mind our goal is to ensure the core stays lean, robust, and breathtakingly fast. Additional non-core functionality should be provided by NPM modules. We'll make this possible/easier as time goes on.

Tip: When developing on the SocketStream JS client (/lib/frontend/client/socketstream.coffee) be sure to have the server running at the same time as this will re-compile/minify everything for you.

If you wish to discuss an idea, or want to chat about anything else, email us at info@socketstream.org
